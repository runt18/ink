# Ink

Ink is a tool for automating the process of incrementing version numbers, which becomes especially tedious when you have multiple manifest files to maintain for different package managers.

# Install

`[sudo] npm install ink`

# Use

Run `ink` from the same directory as your manifests.

# To-do
- More manifest types
- Automatically update `CHANGELOG.md` with an entry for the new version and open it in a text editor.
    - Use Git commit messages to auto-populate with changes?
